## Applyr

-- A simple job application tracking app built with react.

# Why I built this?
-- Just to practice building something that is useful in real world from user's pov. Plus, to sharpen my skills in react and learn new stuff.

# Features:
1. Full CRUD features
2. LocalStorage for data persistance
3. Sort, Filter, and Clear Job Entries
4. Basic Stats on Dashboard and Stats Page
5. Simple Error Handling and Form Validation
6. Fully responsive

# Limitations:
1. No backend and auth
2. Lack of complex stats and data visualization
3. Lack of real time form validation

-- In a nutshell, its not very polished project, but it did help me a lot of concepts and experience developing apps at this scale. Plus, I learned a lot of concepts and stuff that you could only learn by actually coding and struggling instead of just watching and following youtube tutorials. So, feedback and suggestions welcome!
